# **Personal Fitness Tracker System 🏋️‍♂️**  

## 🌟 **Project Goal**  
The goal of this project is to create a fitness tracker system that enables users to:  
- Log workouts and calorie intake.   
- Track their daily progress.  
- Reset daily progress and receive motivational feedback.  

This project focuses on using **Python basics** like strings, lists, loops, conditionals, and functions, giving students practical coding experience.

## ✅ **Project Requirements**  

### 📌 **Tasks to Implement**  
1. **Log Workout**  
   Allow users to log the type of workout and duration (e.g., "Running" for 30 minutes).

3. **View Progress**  
   Display the total workout time and calorie intake for the day with motivational feedback.  

4. **Reset Progress**  
   Clear all workout and calorie data for the day.  

5. **Set Daily Goals**  
   Allow users to set goals for daily workout duration and calorie intake.  

6. **Encouragement System**  
   Provide feedback based on whether the daily goals are met.

2. **Create a New GitHub Repository**  
   - Open GitHub Desktop.  
   - Go to `File > New Repository`.  
   - Fill in the details:  
     - **Name**: Give your repository a name, e.g., `fitness-tracker`.  
     - **Description**: Add a brief description, e.g., "A personal fitness tracker system built with Python."  
     - **Local Path**: Choose a folder on your computer where the repository will be stored.  
     - **Git Ignore Template**: Choose `Python` from the dropdown to exclude unnecessary files.  
   - Click **Create Repository**.

   - Add a message in the "Summary" box, e.g., `Initial commit: Added fitness tracker files`.  
   - Click **Commit to main**.

5. **Publish Your Repository to GitHub**  
   - Click the **Publish Repository** button in GitHub Desktop.  
   - Check the box **Keep this code private** if you want the repository to be private (only you can see it).  
   - Click **Publish Repository**.

6. **Push Updates to GitHub**  
   - Whenever you make changes to your project, GitHub Desktop will detect them.  
   - Add a new **Summary** for your changes, e.g., `Updated log_workout function`.
